# Huffman_Coding_Zipping_and_Unzipping_File

Description:

In this C++ project, we have developed a comprehensive program for Huffman coding and decoding, leveraging object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. Huffman coding, a fundamental technique in data compression, utilizes a greedy algorithm to create an optimal variable-length prefix encoding for a given set of characters based on their frequencies. This encoding allows for efficient data compression and decompression.

Key Components:

Object-Oriented Approach: We adopted an object-oriented approach to design and implement the Huffman coding system. This approach encapsulates functionality into classes, promoting modularity, code reusability, and maintainability.

Class Design: The project consists of classes such as HuffmanTree, HuffmanNode, and HuffmanCoder. These classes are responsible for representing the Huffman tree, nodes, and encoding/decoding operations, respectively.

Greedy Algorithm: We implemented a greedy algorithm within the HuffmanTree class to efficiently construct a Huffman tree. The algorithm selects and combines the two nodes with the lowest frequencies at each step, creating a binary tree where characters closer to the root have shorter encodings.

Vectors: We employed C++ vectors to store and manage character frequencies, as well as to construct the initial forest of trees before merging them into a Huffman tree. Vectors provide dynamic sizing and easy manipulation of data.

Queue: A queue data structure is utilized to keep track of the intermediate Huffman trees during the construction process within the HuffmanTree class. This ensures that the merging of nodes is done in the correct order, facilitating the creation of the final Huffman tree.

Functionality:

Encapsulation: The project encapsulates the encoding and decoding functionality within the HuffmanCoder class, making it easy to use and maintain. Clients of the class can simply create an instance and call methods to encode or decode data.

Dynamic Memory Management: C++'s dynamic memory allocation and deallocation capabilities are employed to manage the creation and destruction of Huffman tree nodes, optimizing memory usage.

Benefits:

OOP Principles: By applying OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction, the project achieves a well-structured and maintainable codebase.

Efficient Compression: Huffman coding provides efficient data compression, especially for data with varying character frequencies.

Dynamic Data Structures: The use of vectors and queues, along with dynamic memory management, enables dynamic handling of data and ensures the correctness of the Huffman tree construction.

Versatile: Huffman coding can be applied to various applications, such as file compression and data transmission, where efficient data representation is crucial.

This C++ project demonstrates your proficiency in object-oriented programming, including class design, encapsulation, and dynamic memory management, while also showcasing your ability to implement a classic algorithm for practical data compression and decompression.
